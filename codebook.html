<h1>Code book</h1>

<p>The objectives of this code is to present a tidy dataset base on the UCI HAR Dataset. The description for the original dataset is below. Following that, I describe how I&#39;ve summarized the data.</p>

<h1>Original UCI Desctiprion: Feature Selection </h1>

<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix &#39;t&#39; to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). </p>

<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the &#39;f&#39; to indicate frequency domain signals). </p>

<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br/>
&#39;-XYZ&#39; is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<p>tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag</p>

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: </p>

<p>mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.</p>

<p>Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:</p>

<p>gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean</p>

<p>The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in &#39;features.txt&#39;</p>

<h1>Summarized Data Approach</h1>

<p>First, we were are only interested in measurements of mean and standard deviation for all the metrics . The variable &ldquo;meanandstd&rdquo; identifies the hows of the metrics in the original data set that are measurements of mean and standard deviation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;features&rdquo; identified the metrics collected in the original study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;trainsub&rdquo;, &ldquo;trainx&rdquo;, and &ldquo;trainy&rdquo; are the subjects, data, and activity indexes respectively of the training set. </p>

<p>&ldquo;test sub&rdquo;, &ldquo;tests&rdquo;, and &ldquo;testy&rdquo; are the subjects, data, and activity indexes respectively of the test set. </p>

<p>&ldquo;makenames&rdquo; is a function that replaces the names of the features with human readable factor names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;all data&rdquo; is the merged set of training and test data.</p>

<p>&ldquo;tidy&rdquo; is created by taking the means of all the metrics summarized by subject and activity.</p>
