First, we were are only interested in measurements of mean and standard deviation for all the metrics . The variable "meanandstd" identifies the hows of the metrics in the original data set that are measurements of mean and standard deviation.

"features" identified the metrics collected in the original study.

"trainsub", "trainx", and "trainy" are the subjects, data, and activity indexes respectively of the training set. 

"test sub", "tests", and "testy" are the subjects, data, and activity indexes respectively of the test set. 

"makenames" is a function that replaces the names of the features with human readable factor names.

"all data" is the merged set of training and test data.

"tidy" is created by taking the means of all the metrics summarized by subject and activity.
